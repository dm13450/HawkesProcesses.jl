# HawkesProcesses

A Julia package for fitting, analysing and plotting Hawkes processes.

The parameters of the Hawkes process can be inferred using the enhanced Bayesian MCMC algorithm as discussed here. 

## Features

I provide a number of different tools to both fit and analyse a collection of events using Hawkes processes.

### Simulation of a Hawkes process

```julia
bg = 0.5
kappa = 0.5
kernel(x) = pdf.(Distributions.Exponential(1/0.5), x)
maxT = 100
simevents = HawkesProcesses.simulate(bg, kappa, kernel, maxT)
```

### Enhance Bayesian Inference

Sample the parameters of a Hawkes process using the latent variable Bayesian MCMC algorithm.
Currently only constant background, constant Îº and exponential kernel are available, but this will be extend to generic functions in the future.  

```julia
bgSamps, kappaSamps, kernSamps = HawkesProcesses.fit(simEvents, maxT, 1000)
```

### Calculate the likelihood for a Hawkes process

```julia
likelihood = HawkesProcesses.likelihood(simevents, bg, kappa, Distributions.Exponential(1/0.5))
```

 ### Intensity calculation

```julia
intensity = HawkesProcesses.intensity(ts, simevents, bg, kappa, kernel)
```

## To Do

* Make functions consistent with Julia style guide.
* Check type safety
* Return parent vector from simulate.

## Next Features

* Likelihood with functional background
* Generic Bayesian inference.
