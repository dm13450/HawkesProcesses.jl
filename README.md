# HawkesProcess

A Julia package for fitting Hawkes processes.


## Features

 * Hawkes simulation
 * Likelihood evaluation
 * Intensity calculation
 * Enhanced Bayesian inference

This package provides a both frequentist and Bayesian methods for fitting a Hawkes process.

Hawkes models can be fitted with maximum likelihood with constant background, kappa. The kernel can be a Distribution type object.


Enhanced Bayesian sampling can be performed with constant background, constant kappa and exponential kernel.
